mod common;

// Phase 2 Migration Note:
// Pure validation tests have been moved to unit tier:
// - TestContext tests → tests/common/mod.rs
// - ZedCopilot extension tests → src/lib.rs
//
// This file is retained as a placeholder for future fixture-based integration tests.
// Currently, all core functionality is covered by unit tests.
// When adding E2E or fixture-composition tests, they should be placed here.
